## Accessing the Database

The first laboratory exercise is to connect to a database, populate it with data, and run very simple SQL queries.

- In case a shared database is provided for course students, user accounts need to be created on the database. Otherwise, the lab should also cover setting up a database system. Information on setting up a database may be found [here](https://www.db-book.com/db6/lab-dir/index.html)
- The next step is to connect to the database. Although most databases have their own text-based interface, we recommend using a graphical interface such as the database browser of the Netbeans IDE, or a database specific interface. More information on accessing these interfaces may be found [here](https://www.db-book.com/db6/lab-dir/index.html).
- The next step is to create tables and load sample data. Scripts for these tasks can be found [here](http://db-book.com/db6/lab-dir/sample_tables-dir/index.html).
- Try out some queries, and see what they do. Some example queries:
  - select * from instructor
  - select name from instructor where dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.' and salary > 70000
  - select * from instructor, department where instructor.dept_name = department.dept_name

## Basic SQL

This lab covers simple SQL queries. A sample lab (for a 2 to 3 hour session) can be found [here](https://www.db-book.com/db6/lab-dir/labexercises-dir/Lab1.html).

## Intermediate SQL

This lab covers more complex SQL queries. A sample lab (for a 2 to 3 hour session) can be found [here](https://www.db-book.com/db6/lab-dir/labexercises-dir/Lab2.html).
